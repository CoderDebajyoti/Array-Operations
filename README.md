## Introduction

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, essential for efficiently storing and managing collections of data. This repository provides a series of examples demonstrating how to perform key operations on arrays. Each operation is implemented in C, with well-documented code to help you understand the logic behind each function.

## Operations Covered

The repository includes examples of the following array operations:

1. **Insertion**: How to add elements at specific positions in an array.
2. **Deletion**: Techniques for removing elements from an array.
3. **Traversal**: Accessing and processing each element in the array sequentially.
4. **Searching**: Finding the index of a specific element in the array.
5. **Sorting**: Arranging elements in ascending or descending order.
6. **Merging**: Combining two or more arrays into a single array.
7. **Splitting**: Dividing an array into multiple smaller arrays.
8. **Updating**: Modifying the value of an element at a specific index.

Each of these operations is accompanied by an example program, making it easier to understand how the operation works in practice.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CoderDebajyoti/Array-Operations.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd Array-Operations
    ```

3. Compile the C files using a C compiler, for example:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o output
    ```
4. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./output
    ```

## Usage

This repository is designed for educational purposes. You can explore each example to learn how different array operations are implemented. Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different inputs, and enhance your understanding of array manipulation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the examples or adding new array operations, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Let's make this a valuable resource for everyone learning arrays.
